1️⃣ How people usually organize this (practical tip)

Most producers do something like:

samples/
├── drums/
│   ├── kicks/
│   ├── snares/
│   ├── hats/
│   └── toms/
├── percussion/
├── fx/
│   ├── risers/
│   ├── impacts/
│   └── glitches/
├── synth/
│   ├── stabs/
│   ├── pads/
│   └── bass/

This structure works beautifully with AI systems later (classification, tagging, embedding, etc.).

If you want to go one step further (very you)

Next logical step for your project would be:
- auto-tag samples with embeddings
- map MoodItem -> sample cluster
- dynamically assemble background beds instead of fixed tracks

If you want, I can help you design:
- a sample ingestion + tagging pipeline
- or a minimal legal-safe "starter corpus" (≈5-10k samples) suitable for ML experiments
