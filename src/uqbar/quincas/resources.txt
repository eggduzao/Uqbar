You're talking about sample libraries / sound packs - the raw material of electronic music: kicks, snares, hats, toms, FX, textures, synth stabs, risers, glitches, etc. There is a whole ecosystem for legally free-to-use collections, and it's a bit fragmented, so here's the clean map.

I'll separate 100% free & safe, free-with-conditions, and curated professional freebies.

⸻

1️⃣ 100% Free, No Strings (royalty-free, attribution usually not required)

🔹 99Sounds
- Curated packs (often genre-specific)
- High quality, modern electronic sounds
- License: royalty-free (check pack page, but generally safe)

👉 https://99sounds.org/

⸻

🔹 Sample Focus
- Individual samples (not packs)
- You can filter by drum / FX / synth / genre
- Free tier gives limited daily downloads

👉 https://samplefocus.com/

⸻

🔹 Bedroom Producers Blog
- Probably the best hub for free, legal sample packs
- They review and aggregate other people's free packs
- Very trustworthy

👉 https://bedroomproducersblog.com/

(Search for "free sample packs")

⸻

2️⃣ Massive Archives (older but huge)

🔹 Freesound
- Tens of thousands of sounds
- VERY IMPORTANT: filter by license
- Use CC0 or Attribution-Free
- Some sounds are raw field recordings, others are clean synth/drums

👉 https://freesound.org/
(Filter -> License -> CC0)

💡 Pro tip: search terms like
kick, snare, hat, fx, impact, whoosh, drone

⸻

🔹 SampleSwap
- Old-school, but lots of drum hits & loops
- Mostly free-use, but read their license page once

👉 https://sampleswap.org/

⸻

3️⃣ Professional-Grade Freebies (used by real producers)

🔹 Splice (Free Packs Section)

👉 https://splice.com/sounds/free

⸻

🔹 Ableton (Free Packs)
- Even if you don't use Ableton
- Extremely polished electronic sounds

👉 https://www.ableton.com/en/packs/

(Filter -> Free)

⸻

4️⃣ Synth & FX-focused (very "AI-music vibe")

🔹 Wave Alchemy (Free section)
- Clean, studio-quality drums
- Classic analog flavor

👉 https://www.wavealchemy.co.uk/free-samples/

⸻

🔹 MusicRadar
- Regularly releases huge free packs (1000+ samples)
- Covers drums, synths, cinematic FX

👉 https://www.musicradar.com/news/tech/sampleradar-collections-634253

⸻

5️⃣ Licensing rule of thumb (important)

For your music + AI project, stick to one of these licenses:
- CC0 -> safest (public domain)
- Royalty-Free / Free for Commercial Use
- Avoid anything requiring attribution in audio output

If the license says:

"Free to use in music productions"
you're good.

If it says:

"Not for redistribution as samples"
that's also fine - you're using, not redistributing raw samples.

Got it. Thank you for the reset — this helps a lot.
We stay with literary creations / figures / characters / titles, not authors, not mythology, not real people, and short, evocative, safe names that carry imagery, not biography.

Think: characters, narrative objects, archetypes that feel invented, like Faust, Frankenstein, Moby Dick, Robin Hood.

Below is a carefully curated list, grouped by vibe, with short explanations so you can feel each one.

⸻

🧩 Clever / Automatable / “Why wasn’t this always done?”

(Perfect for tiny tools that quietly solve things)
	•	Bartleby — minimalism, refusal to overdo things
	•	Little John — helper, sidekick, strength without spotlight
	•	Friday — utility, assistance, reliability
	•	Milo — shortcuts, systems, clever mechanics
	•	Pip — small beginnings, growth, leverage

⸻

⚙️ Precision / Focus / Single-purpose Power

(Tools that do one thing, sharply)
	•	Ishmael — observer, glue logic, narrator of systems
	•	Ahab — ⚠️ strong focus (borderline obsessive, but powerful)
	•	Gregor — transformation, state change
	•	K. — procedural logic, bureaucracy-as-code
	•	Prospero — orchestration, control, command

⸻

🌱 Gentle / Friendly / Safe-for-Use Names

(These feel trustworthy — ideal for utilities)
	•	Paddington — polite, helpful, dependable
	•	Winnie — simple, warm, quietly wise
	•	Hobbit — small scale, big effectiveness (safe despite Tolkien)
	•	Snoopy — playful, iconic, harmless overlap
	•	Piglet — gentle, supportive, background helper

⸻

🧠 Intellectual / Elegant / “Literary Tool”

(Names that feel smart without being ominous)
	•	Ulysses — journey, structure, complexity (name itself is myth-adjacent but modern-literary)
	•	Candide — naive logic encountering reality
	•	Gulliver — scale shifts, perspective changes
	•	Fahrenheit — threshold, limit, measurement
	•	Clockwork — mechanisms, automation imagery

⸻

🕯 Serious but Not Unsafe

(Weighty, but still professional and usable)
	•	Lear — judgment, error, insight
	•	Crusoe — survival logic, self-sufficiency
	•	Jekyll — dual modes / toggles (borderline, but useful metaphor)
	•	Hyde — hidden behavior (use carefully)
	•	Dorian — state drift, hidden decay (probably too dark for tools)

⸻

🏆 Best Fits for Your Exact Idea

If I had to strongly shortlist names that feel:

“small code, automatable, literary, safe, memorable”

These stand out:
	•	Bartleby → minimalist automation
	•	Milo → shortcuts & systems
	•	Friday → helper utilities
	•	Little John → sidekick tools
	•	Pip → small → powerful
	•	Ishmael → observer / glue logic
	•	Paddington → friendly utility

⸻

One guiding rule (worth keeping)

Good tool names feel like characters you’d trust to help you, not stories that warn you.

If you want next, I can:
	•	restrict to single-word only
	•	restrict to ≤5 letters
	•	restrict to no Shakespeare
	•	or help you build a coherent naming family (core name + sub-tools)

Just point the constraint 💛

---

To fit a CLI (Command Line Interface) software, names should ideally be short (2-3 syllables), easy to type, and evoke a sense of utility, power, or mystery.

The following 30 names are derived strictly from fictional literary artifacts, creatures, or entities (avoiding real mythology or religion) that are catchy enough for a command line:

1. The Artifacts & Machines (Short & Punchy)

Aleph (From Borges’ The Aleph) – A point in space that contains all other points.
Palantir (From Tolkien’s LOTR) – A seeing-stone used for communication and observation.
Vril (From Bulwer-Lytton’s The Coming Race) – A mysterious, all-permeating energy source.
Ansible (From Le Guin’s Hainish Cycle) – A device for instantaneous communication across light-years.
Axiom (From the ship in WALL-E / Asimov themes) – A self-evident truth or a central hub.
Tralfamadore (From Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-Five) – Shortened to Tralfa, a distant, Fourth-dimensional logic.
Seldon (From Asimov’s Foundation) – Referring to the mathematical "Seldon Plan."
Grok (From Heinlein’s Stranger in a Strange Land) – To understand something intuitively and fully.
Multivac (From Asimov’s short stories) – The ultimate supercomputer.
Babel (From The Library of Babel / The Hitchhiker's Guide) – A universal translator or infinite library.

2. The Entities & Constructs (Catchy & Characterful)

HAL (From Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey) – The most famous, albeit eerie, CLI-style interface.
Gollum (From Tolkien) – Small, efficient, and obsessed with a single task.
Shai (From Herbert’s Dune) – From "Shai-Hulud," the great worm; implies power under the surface.
Boxer (From Orwell’s Animal Farm) – The horse that represents hard work and "doing more."
Queequeg (From Melville’s Moby Dick) – A loyal, skilled, and mysterious companion.
Mowgli (From Kipling’s The Jungle Book) – A navigator between two different worlds (user and kernel).
Zaphod (From Adams’ Hitchhiker's Guide) – Fast, multi-headed, and eccentric.
Friday (From Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe) – The ultimate assistant/helper.
Caliban (From Shakespeare’s The Tempest) – A raw, powerful force of nature governed by commands.
Fiver (From Adams’ Watership Down) – A small rabbit with prophetic vision.

3. Abstract & "New-Weird" Literary References

Uqbar (From Borges’ Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius) – A fictional place that becomes real through documentation. *****
Odradek (From Kafka’s The Cares of a Family Man) – A strange, star-shaped, indestructible living object.
Gantua (From Rabelais’ Gargantua) – For software that handles "huge" amounts of data.
Lilliput (From Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels) – For a "micro" service or tiny utility.
Nadsat (From Burgess’ A Clockwork Orange) – The fictional language; perfect for a CLI parser.
Fahrenheit (From Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451) – Evokes heat, speed, and data processing.
Erewhon (From Butler’s Erewhon) – An anagram of "Nowhere"; a satirical utopia.
R.U.R. (From Čapek’s Rossum's Universal Robots) – The origin of the word "Robot."
Arrakis (From Herbert’s Dune) – Harsh, dry, and full of "spice" (valuable data).
Yossarian (From Heller’s Catch-22) – For a tool that solves paradoxical logic problems.

Recommendation: For a simple, professional CLI, Aleph, Ansible, or Vril are the most type-friendly. If you want something with more personality, Grok or Fiver are excellent choices.
